Here one chooses a model for the plant, whose parameters are unknown, and the plant parameters are recursively estimated; controller gains are computed assuming that the present estimate is corrent. We first study algorithms to carry out parameter estimation, we then look at various control laws, and finally these are combined to yield an adaptive controller.

For any current tax rule, the idea is to identify the underlying policy problem the rule is intended to solve, consider alternative solutions, and then determine if the current tax rule can be improved.  Students will apply this procedure in a major essay.  In class, topics discussed will include: the process of formulating tax policy and the roles of Finance; CCRA; courts, lobby groups, etc.; the goals of taxation such as fairness and neutrality; tax evasion and the underground economy; flat taxes and single-rate taxes versus progressive-rate taxes; and implementing incentives through the tax system versus as direct government expenditures.  This course is intended to make students think about the purpose of tax rules.  Tax rules are just so many random bits of information unless you understand the purpose of the rules.  Understanding the purpose helps you remember the rules and makes you better able to explain them to clients.  Also, by identifying gaps and inconsistencies where the rules do not achieve their purpose, you may be able to identify tax planning opportunities and areas where the rules may change in the future."

They also cover tax and economic issues which might be addressed only tangentially in other courses.  The object of the class is to combine administrative, policy and technical issues in a practical context.  Practitioners are often invited to discuss specialized areas of tax practice and procedure."

And how are children able to recognize what others pretend?  Are children behaviourists about pretend play? Or does successful pretence signal that your children engage in mental state reasoning ('theory of mind')?  Theories of children's (and adults') pretence have sought to provide answers to the questions.  These theories are still actively debated, and are the main topic of this course.  Relevant experimental work will also be discussed."

The ability to reason about beliefs, desires, and other mental states is often called \"theory of mind.\"  How this ability develops in childhood, has been greatly debated over the past 20 years, and remains mysterious (e.g. how can we learn that people have mental states when we cannot see mental states, but only infer them by observing people's behaviour).

Different types of states have addressed ethnic problems in different ways: some have sought to maintain harmonious multicultural communities: others have preferred to assimilate or segregate minorities; yet others have engaged in ethnic cleansing.  We will trace the roots of nationalism and the consequences of its rise, and we will also discuss the impact of state system on the ethnic policy."

These inequalities can be seen across various axes including gender, ethnicity, and access to material resources. As such, those relatively deprived/underprivileged have substantially poorer health than those better off. The course will demonstrate the extent of inequalities in health, and it will explore current theories explaining how inequalities arise, focusing on behavioural/cultural, psychosocial, and structural/material explanations. The course will also investigate the role of various approaches to economic and social policy in creating or reducing inequalities."

Though the bulk of the material deals with Europe in the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries, the course is methodological in nature and is intended for all graduate students of social history.\r\n\r\nStudents in HIST 622 read the great microhistories including Davis' The Return of Martin Guerre, LeRoy Ladurie's Montaillou and Caranaval at Romans, Spence's The Death of Woman Wang, Ginzburg's Night Battles, and others.  Through these sources students acquire a deep understanding of the historiography surrounding this genre.  In addition, HIST 622 exposes students to the various non-historical theorists (sociological, anthropological, etc.) whose works inform the microhistorical method."

Recent developments in the area of intelligent systems and soft computing have presented powerful alternatives for dealing with the behavior of this class of systems.  This course outlines fundamentals of soft computing based design approaches using such tools as approximate reasoning, fuzzy inferencing, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and neuro-fuzzy systems.  Fundamentals and advances on these procedures are outlined along with their potential applications to various real world applications in virtually most fields of engineering including pattern recognition, system planning, classification, power generation, intelligent transportation, systems and control, intelligent mechatronics, optimization, communication, robotics and manufacturing, to name a few."

This refers to sequential state estimation.  For nonlinear dynamical systems, the EFK (Extended Kalman filter) can be used by a liberalization of the stat space model.  Particle filters are used to address state estimation problems where the systems are non-linear and non-Gaussian.  Particle Filters are rooted in Bayesian estimation and Monte Carlo procedures.

Theoretical and empirical exploration of core operations concepts such as supply chain management, process configuration, quality and process improvement, and lean systems will be undertaken. Once a strong foundational understanding of these core concepts is achieved, students will then explore the opportunities and threats posed by emergent social and environmental issues to organizations, and how those issues can be integrated into the strategy underlying operations and process management. Concepts such as eco-efficiency, sustainable supply chain management, environmental management systems (e.g., ISO 14000), and life cycle assessment will be explored."

It will cover the full range of issues involved in the rational use of anti-cancer agents, from the older cytotoxic drugs through to newer agents targeted at particular steps in cell regulatory pathways.  A broad overview of the pathology of cancer is included.  Although drug mechanisms will be addressed, there is an equivalent emphasis on what these drugs mean to the patient.  Students will consider the disease itself, the behavior of the diagnosed patient, the issues around drug administration, the extensive side effects and the various supportive strategies that are required to take the patient through the very stressful course of systemic cancer therapy."

Genetic variation also modulates how we respond to our environments.  Minor variants in genetic code can affect physiological outcomes such as changes in body mass with caloric restriction, changes in endurance capacity with exercise training, and changes in circulating cholesterol levels with high protein intakes.  Understanding how genetic variability affects health outcomes will be key to providing early diagnosis and prevention measures to optimize performance, prevent disease, and maximize longevity for individuals.  It will also be key to prescribing optimal personalized lifestyle interventions, ranging from diet to exercise to stress reduction and sleep modulation to promote maximal well-being.  In addition, recent advances in gene editing technology will be covered, including discussion of ethical issues surrounding application to human embryos and potential for misuse bioterrorism."

Since these challenges have been mastered, a wealth of research has accumulated on how culture influences cognition, emotion, and the self. We will first review and discuss this work. We will next discuss a set of new challenges for culture and psychology. Such challenges include questions about conceptual clarity, within-cultural and sub-cultural variations (e.g., variations due to social status, class, religion, or political affiliation), differentiation and integration of processes at the group vs. individual level of analysis, modeling of how cultural processes unfold over time, and integration of insights from etic and emic methodological approaches.

Philosophers tend to take a normative stand. In contrast, psychologists tend to explore the variations in the psychological processes underlying wisdom. We will focus on the unique combination of these approaches to understand what wisdom may be and how it may be obtained, and explore the distribution of wisdom-related processes in the domain of difficult life experiences and in daily life."

The future of the public service is one that acknowledges that these systems need change, but that change can only come from new ways of working, of approaching challenges, and of understanding the relationship between public and public service. The digital era has not only ushered in new public expectations of government, but an ever-present need for the public service to renew itself to meet those expectations. This course will explore what government can and should look like in a digital era, while also examining how this digital transformation is already being done, but inside the public sector and beyond."

This course analyzes the ways in which humans affect river systems, the physical and social mechanisms which complicate the relationship between humans and rivers, and how humans can restore rivers to a more natural state. This course also compares geomorphic, ecologic, and social functioning of rivers in pre- and post-alteration systems. The major theme of this course is navigating the delicate balance between allowing rivers to flow naturally and maintain ecologic functionality while simultaneously maintaining the river's ability to provide services of use to humans. What does human alteration of river systems mean for the current and future state of river ecology, morphology, and hydrology? Can we find a way for rivers to provide functionality that satisfies the needs of both society and nature? This course provides students with the background and tools to take on these and other essential questions and challenges."

In most community and primary settings, stigma about substance use presents an additional barrier to addressing the impacts of substance use on disease and medication management. This course focuses on substance use in any form and how it affects disease progression, pharmaceutical care including drug interactions, and public health. We identify traditional and emerging types of research and information, including data from non-medical research sources. Community engagement and the pharmacists becoming a community substance educator will be explored. Drug and drug classes covered include opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, prescription and other stimulants, GABAergic drugs, serotonergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic hallucinogens, entactogens, alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis."

Cities emerge through historical power relations, including contradictions between production (capital accumulation) and socio-ecological reproduction. They are places of hope, wealth accumulation, innovation and cultural vibrancy. But, as we will explore, cities are characterized by social struggles over: the uneven distribution of wealth and opportunities; a desire for deeper democratic participation; inequitable access to services and public space; unequal distribution of environmental benefits and harms; increasing state and corporate surveillance; philosophies and practices of security, policing and incarceration; and related discriminatory processes according to people¿s gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, ability and (legal) status. We draw on case studies from cities around the world to critically assess progressive policies, programs and grassroots-led initiatives aimed at resolving these conflicts. This course focuses on solutions aimed at: increasing affordable housing and access to public transportation; redistributing wealth (e.g., through tax policy and public ownership); creating good jobs; planning for equity; and deepening participatory urban governance."
